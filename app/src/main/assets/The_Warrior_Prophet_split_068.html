<span class="italic1"><span class="bold1">Winter, 4111 Year-of-the-Tusk, Caraskand</span></span>
</span></span></h1><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<div class="calibre13"><span class="calibre8">The following morning a pall of smoke lay over Caraskand. The city quilted the distance, pocked here and there by great, gutted structures. The dead lay everywhere, piled beneath smoking tabernacles, sprawled through sacked palaces, scattered across the reaches of Caraskand’s famed bazaars. Cats lapped blood from the grouting. Crows pecked at sightless eyes.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">A single horn echoed mournfully across the rooftops. Still groggy from the previous day’s debauch, the Men of the Tusk stirred, anticipating a day of repentance and sombre celebration. But from various quarters of the city more horns blared out, sounding the call to arms. Iron-mailed knights clacked down streets, crying out frantic alarums.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Those who climbed the southern walls saw divisions of many-coloured horsemen spilling across ridge lines and down sparsely wooded hills. At long last, Kascamandri I, the Padirajah of Kian, had taken the field against the Inrithi. The Great Names desperately tried to muster their thanes and barons, but with their men scattered throughout the city, it was hopeless. Gothyelk, still distraught over the loss of his youngest, Gurnyau, couldn’t be roused, and the Tydonni refused to leave the city without the beloved Earl of Agansanor. With the recent death of Prince Skaiyelt, the long-haired Thunyeri had disintegrated into clannish mobs, and, unaccountably, had renewed their bloody sack of the city. And the Ainoni Palatines, with Chepheramunni on his death bed, had fallen to feuding amongst themselves. The horns called and called, but far too few answered.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">The Fanim horsemen descended so quickly that most of the Holy War’s siege camps had to be abandoned, along with the war engines and the food supplies amassed within them. Retreating knights set several of the camps ablaze to prevent them from falling into the heathen’s hands. Hundreds of those too sick to flee the camps were left to be massacred. Those bands of Inrithi knights who dared contest the Padirajah’s advance were quickly thrown back or overrun, encompassed by waves of ululating horsemen. By mid-morning the Great Names frantically recalled those remaining outside Caraskand and bent themselves to defending the vast circuit of the city’s walls.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Celebration had turned to terror and disbelief. They were imprisoned in a city that had already been besieged for weeks. The Great Names ordered hasty surveys of the remaining food stores. They despaired after learning that Imbeyan had burned the city’s granaries when he realized he’d lost Caraskand. And of course, the vast storerooms of the city’s final redoubt, the Citadel of the Dog, had been destroyed by the Scarlet Spires. The broken fortress burned still, a beacon on Caraskand’s easternmost hill.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Seated upon a lavish settee, surrounded by his counsellors and his many children, Kascamandri ab Tepherokar watched from the terrace of a hillside villa as the great horns of his army inexorably closed about Caraskand. Propped against his whale-like belly, his lovely girls peppered him with questions about what happened. For months he’d followed the Holy War from the fleshpot sanctuaries of the Korasha, the exalted White-Sun Palace in Nenciphon. He’d trusted the sagacity and warlike temper of his subordinates. And he’d scorned the idolatrous Inrithi, thinking them barbarous and hapless in the ways of war.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">No longer.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">To redress his negligence, he’d raised a host worthy of his jihadic fathers: the survivors of Anwurat, some sixty thousand strong, under the peerless Cinganjehoi, who had set aside his enmity to his Padirajah; the Grandees of Chianadyni, the Kianene homeland, with some forty thousand horsemen under Kascamandri’s own ruthless and brilliant son, Fanayal; and Kascamandri’s old tributary, King Pilasakanda of Girgash, whose vassal Hetmen marched with thirty thousand black-skinned Fanim and one hundred mastodons from pagan Nilnamesh. These last, in particular, caused the Padirajah to take pride, for the lumbering beasts made his daughters gape and giggle.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">As evening fell, the Padirajah ordered an assault on Caraskand’s walls, hoping to use the disarray of the idolaters to his advantage. Ladders made by Inrithi carpenters were drawn up, as well as the single siege tower they’d captured intact, and there was fierce fighting along the walls around the Ivory Gates. The mastodons were yoked to a mighty iron-headed ram made by the Men of the Tusk, and soon drumming thunder and elephant screams could be heard above the roar of battling men. But the iron men refused to yield the heights, and the Kianene and Girgashi suffered horrendous losses—including some fourteen mastodons, burned alive by flaming pitch. Kascamandri’s youngest daughter, beautiful Sirol, wept.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">When the sun finally set, the Men of the Tusk greeted the darkness with both relief and horror. For they were saved and they were doomed.</span></div>
<div class="calibre2"><img alt="131" src="images/00132.jpg" class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<div class="calibre13"><span class="calibre8">The deep, staccato thunder of drums.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">With Cnaiür standing behind him, Proyas leaned against a limestone battlement on the summit of the Gate of Horns, peering through an embrasure at the muddy plains below. Kianene teemed across the landscape, dragging Inrithi wares and shelters to immense bonfires, pitching bright pavilions, reinforcing palisades and earthworks. Bands of silver-helmed horsemen patrolled the ridge lines, galloped through orchards or across fields between byres.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">The Inrithi had chosen the same plains to launch their assaults: the burned hulk of a siege tower stood no more than a stone’s throw from where Proyas had positioned himself. He squeezed shut his burning eyes. <span class="italic">This can’t be happening! Not this!</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">First the euphoria—the rapture!—of Caraskand’s fall. Then the Padirajah, who’d for so long been little more than a rumour of terrible power to the south, had materialized in the hills above the city. At first Proyas could only think that someone had made a catastrophic mistake, that everything would resolve itself once the chaos of the city’s ransacking passed. Those silk-cowled divisions couldn’t be Kianene horsemen … The heathen had been mortally wounded at Anwurat—undone! The Holy War had taken mighty Caraskand, the great gate of Xerash and Amoteu, and now stood poised to march into the Sacred Lands! They were <span class="italic">so close</span> …</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">So close that Shimeh, he was certain, could see Caraskand’s smoke on the horizon.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">But the horsemen <span class="italic">had</span> been Kianene. Riding beneath the White Padirajic Lion, they streamed about the great circuit of the city’s walls, burning the impoverished Inrithi camps, slaughtering the sick, and riding down those foolish enough to resist their advance. Kascamandri had come; both the God—and hope—had forsaken them.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“How many do you estimate?” Proyas asked the Scylvendi, who stood, his scarred arms folded across his scale harness.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Does it matter?” the barbarian replied.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Unnerved by the man’s turquoise gaze, Proyas turned back to the smoke-grey vista. Yesterday, while the dimensions of the disaster slowly unfolded, he’d found himself asking why over and over again. Like a wronged child, his thoughts had stamped about the fact of his piety. Who among the Great Names had toiled as he’d toiled? Who’d burned more sacrifices, intoned more prayers? But now he no longer dared ask these questions.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Thoughts of Achamian and Xinemus had seen to that.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">“It is you,”</span> the Marshal of Attrempus had said, <span class="italic">“who surrender everything …”</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">But in the God’s name! For the God’s glory!</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Of course it matters,” Proyas hissed. He knew the Scylvendi would bristle at his tone, but he neither worried nor cared. “We must find some way out!”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Exactly,” Cnaiür said, apparently unperturbed. “We must find some way out … No matter how large the Padirajah’s host.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Scowling, Proyas turned back to the embrasure. He was in no mood to be corrected.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“What of Conphas?” he asked. “Is there any chance he lies about the food?”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">The barbarian shrugged his massive shoulders. “The Nansur are good counters.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“And they’re good liars as well!” Proyas exclaimed. Why couldn’t the man just answer his questions? “Do you think Conphas tells the truth?”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Cnaiür spat across the ancient stonework. “We’ll have to wait … See if he stays fat while we grow thin.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">Curse the man!</span> How could he bait him at such a time, in such straits?</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“You are besieged,” the Scylvendi warrior continued, “within the very city you have spent weeks starving. Even if Conphas does hoard food, it would not be of consequence. You have only one alternative, and one alternative only. The Scarlet Spires must be roused, now, before the Padirajah can assemble his Cishaurim. The Holy War must take to the field.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“You think I disagree?” Proyas cried. “I’ve already petitioned Eleäzaras—and do you know what he says? He says, ‘The Scarlet Spires have already suffered too many needless losses …’ Needless losses! What? Some dozen or so dead at Anwurat—if that! A handful more in the desert—not bad compared to a hundred thousand <span class="italic">faithful</span> souls lost! And what? Five or so struck by Chorae yesterday—heaven forfend! Killed while destroying the only remaining stores of food in Caraskand … All wars should be so bloodless!”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Proyas paused, realized he was panting. He felt crazed and confused, as though he suffered some residue of the fevers. The great, age-worn stones of the barbican seemed to wheel about him. If only, he thought madly, Triamis had built these walls with bread!</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">The Scylvendi watched him without passion. “Then you are doomed,” he said.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Proyas raised his hands to his face, scratched his cheeks. <span class="italic">It can’t be! Something … I’m missing something!</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“We’re cursed,” he murmured. “They’re right … The God does punish us!”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“What are you saying?”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“That maybe Conphas and the others are right about him!”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">The brutal face hardened into a scowl. “Him?”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Kellhus,” Proyas exclaimed. He clutched trembling hands, ground one palm against the other.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">I falter … I fail!</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Proyas had read many accounts of other men floundering in times of crisis, and absurdly, he realized that this—this!—was <span class="italic">his</span> moment of weakness. But contrary to his expectation, there was no strength to be drawn from this knowledge. If anything, knowing he faltered threatened to hasten his collapse. He was too sick … Too tired.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“They rail against him,” he explained, his voice raw. “First Conphas, but now even Gothyelk and Gotian.” Proyas released a shuddering breath. “They claim he’s a False Prophet.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“This is no rumour? They’ve told you this themselves?”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Proyas nodded. “With my support, they think they can openly move against him.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“You would risk a war <span class="italic">within</span> these walls? Inrithi against Inrithi?”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Proyas swallowed, struggled to shore up his gaze. “If that’s what the God demands of me.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“And how does one know what your God demands?”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Proyas stared at the Scylvendi in horror.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“I just …” A pang welled against the back of his throat. Hot tears flooded across his cheek. He inwardly cursed, opened his mouth again, sobbed instead of spoke …</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">Please God!</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">It had been too long. The burden had been too great. Everything! Every day, every word a battle! And the sacrifices—they had cut too deep. The desert, even the hemoplexy, had been nothing. But Achamian—ah, that was something! And Xinemus, whom he’d abandoned. The two men he respected most in the world, given up in the name of Holy War … And still it wasn’t enough!</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">Nothing … Never good enough!</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Tell me, Cnaiür,” he croaked. A strange tooth-baring smile seized his face, and he sobbed again. He covered his eyes and cheeks with his hands, crumpled against the parapet. “Please!” he cried to the stone. “Cnaiür … You must tell me what to do!”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Now it was the Scylvendi who looked horrified.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Go to Kellhus,” the barbarian said. “But I warn you”—he raised a mighty, battle-scarred fist—“secure your heart. Seal it tight!” He lowered his chin and glared, the way a wolf might …</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Go, Proyas. Go ask the man yourself.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre2"><img alt="132" src="images/00133.jpg" class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<div class="calibre13"><span class="calibre8">Like something carved out of living rock, the bed rose from a black dais set in the chamber’s heart. The veils, which usually trailed between the bed’s five stone posts, had been pinned to the emerald and gold canopy. Lying with one leg kicked free of the sheets, Kellhus stroked Esmenet’s cheek, saw past her flushed skin, beyond her beating heart, following the telltale markers all the way to her womb.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">Our blood, Father</span> … In a world of maladroit and bovine souls, nothing could be more precious.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">The House of Anasûrimbor.</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">The Dûnyain not only saw deep, they saw far. Even if the Holy War survived Caraskand, even if Shimeh was reconquered, the wars were only beginning … Achamian had taught him that much.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">And in the end, only sons could conquer death.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">Was this why you summoned me? Do you die?</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“What is it?” Esmenet asked, drawing sheets up to her breast.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Kellhus had jerked forward, sitting cross-legged upon the bed. He peered across the candle-lit gloom, tracking the muffled sounds of some commotion beyond the doors. <span class="italic">What does he</span>—</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Without warning, the double doors burst open, and Kellhus saw Proyas, still weak from his convalescence, struggling with two of the Hundred Pillars.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Kellhus!” the Conriyan Prince barked. “Tell your dogs to kennel, or by the God there’ll be blood!”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">At a word, the bodyguards released him, assumed positions at either side of the door. The man stood, his chest heaving, his eyes searching through the shadows of the lavish bedchamber. Kellhus encircled him with his senses … The man shouted desperation from every pore, but the wildness of his passion made the specifics difficult to ascertain. He feared the Holy War was lost, as did all men, and that Kellhus was somehow to blame—as did many.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">He needs to know what I am.</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“What happens, Proyas? What ails you, that you’d commit such an outrage?”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">But the Prince’s eyes had found Esmenet, rigid with shock. Kellhus instantly saw the peril.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">He searches for excuses.</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">An interior porch had been raised about the doors; Proyas took an unsteady step toward the railing. “What’s she doing?” He blinked in confusion. “Why’s she <span class="italic">in your bed?”</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">He doesn’t want to understand.</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“She’s my wife … What business—”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Wife?” Proyas exclaimed. He raised a half-opened hand to his brow. “She’s your <span class="italic">wife?”</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">He’s heard the stories … But all this time he’s afforded me his doubt.</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“The desert, Proyas. The desert marked us all.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">He shook his head. “Fie on the desert,” he murmured, then looked up in sudden fury. “Fie on the desert! She’s … She’s … Akka loved her! <span class="italic">Akka!</span> Don’t you recall? Your <span class="italic">friend</span> …”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Kellhus lowered his eyes in penitent sadness. “We thought he would want this.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Want? Want his best friend fucking the wo—”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Who,” Esmenet spat, “are you to speak of Akka to me!”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“What do you say?” Proyas said, blanching. “What do you mean?” His lips pursed; his eyes slackened. His right hand fell to his chest. Horror had opened a still point in the throng of his passions—an opportunity …</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“But you already know,” Kellhus said. “Of all people, you’ve no right to judge.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">The Conriyan Prince flinched. “What do you mean?”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">Now … Offer him truce. Show him understanding. Make stark his trespasses …</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Please,” Kellhus said, reaching out with word, tone, and every nuance of expression. “You let your despair rule you … And me, I succumb to ill manners. Proyas! You’re among my dearest friends …” He cast aside the sheets, swung his feet to the floor. “Come, let us drink and talk.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">But Proyas had fastened on his earlier comment—as Kellhus had intended. “I would know why I’ve no right to judge. What’s that supposed to mean, ‘dear friend’?”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Kellhus drew his lips into a pained line. “It means that <span class="italic">you,</span> Proyas, not we, have betrayed Achamian.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">The handsome face slackened in horror. His pulse drummed.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">I must move carefully.</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“No,” Proyas said.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Kellhus closed his eyes as though in disappointment. “Yes. You accuse us because you hold yourself accountable.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Accountable? Accountable for what?” He snorted like a frightened adolescent. “I did nothing.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“But you did everything, Proyas. You needed the Scarlet Spires, and the Scarlet Spires needed Achamian.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“No one knows what happened to Achamian!”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“But <span class="italic">you</span> know … I can see this knowledge within you.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">The Conriyan Prince stumbled backward. “You see nothing!”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">So close …</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Of course I do, Proyas. How, after all this time, could you still doubt?”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">But as he watched, something happened: an unforeseen flare of recognition, a cascade of inferences, too quick to silence. <span class="italic">That word</span> …</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Doubt?” Proyas fairly cried. “How could I not doubt? The Holy War stands upon the precipice, Kellhus!”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Kellhus smiled the way Xinemus had once smiled at things both touching and foolish.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“The God <span class="italic">tries</span> us, Proyas. He’s yet to pass sentence! Tell me, how can there be trial without doubt?”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“He tries us …” Proyas repeated, his face blank.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Of <span class="italic">course,</span>” Kellhus said plaintively. “Simply open your heart and you’ll see!”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Open my …” Proyas trailed, his eyes brimming with incredulous dread. “He told me!” he abruptly whispered. “This is what he meant!” The yearning in his look, the ache that had warred against his misgivings, suddenly collapsed into suspicion and disbelief.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">Someone has warned him … The Scylvendi? Has he wandered so far?</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Proyas …”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">I should have killed him.</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“And how about you, <span class="italic">Kellhus?</span>” Proyas spat. “Do you doubt? Does the great Warrior-Prophet fear for the future?”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Kellhus looked to Esmenet, saw that she wept. He reached out and clasped her cold hands.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“No,” he said.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">I do not fear.</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Proyas was already backing out the double doors, into the brighter light of the antechamber.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“You will.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre2"><img alt="133" src="images/00134.jpg" class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<div class="calibre13"><span class="calibre8">For over a thousand years Caraskand’s great limestone walls had stared across the broken countryside of Enathpaneah. When Triamis I, perhaps the greatest of the Aspect-Emperors, had raised them, his detractors in Imperial Cenei had scoffed at the expenditure, claiming that he who conquers all foes has no need of walls. Triamis, the chroniclers write, had dismissed them by saying, “No man can conquer the future.” And indeed, over the ensuing centuries Caraskand’s “Triamic Walls,” as they were called, would blunt the rush of history many times, if not redirect it altogether. And sometimes, they would cage it.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Day after day, it seemed, Inrithi horns blared from the high towers, calling the Men of the Tusk to the ramparts, for the Padirajah threw his people at Triamis’s mighty fortifications with reckless fury, each time convinced the strength of the starving idolaters would fail. Haggard and hungry, Galeoth, Conriyans, and Tydonni manned the war engines abandoned by Caraskand’s erstwhile defenders, casting pots of flaming pitch from mangonels, great iron bolts from ballistae. Thunyeri, Nansur, and Ainoni gathered on the walls, crowding beneath the battlements and huddling beneath shields to avoid volleys of arrows that at times darkened the sun. And day after day, it seemed, they beat the heathen back.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Even as they cursed them, the Kianene could only marvel at their desperate fury. Twice young Athjeäri led daring sorties across the rutted plain, once seizing the sappers’ trenches and collapsing their tunnels, once charging over slovenly earthworks and sacking an isolated encampment. All the world could see they were doomed, and yet they fought as though they knew it not.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">But they knew—as only men stalked by famine could know.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">The hemoplexy, or the hollows, was running its course. Many, such as Chepheramunni, the King-Regent of High Ainon, lingered on death’s marches, while others, such as Zursodda, Palatine-Governor of Koraphea, or Cynnea, Earl of Agmundr, finally succumbed. The funeral pyres still burned, but more and more they took casualties, and not the sick, as their fuel. As the flames consumed the Earl of Agmundr, his famed longbowmen launched burning arrows over the walls, and the Kianene wondered at the madness of the idolaters. Cynnea would be among the last of the great Inrithi lords to perish in the grip of the Disease.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">But even as the plague waned, the threat of starvation waxed. Dread Famine, Bukris, the God who devoured men and vomited up skin and bones, walked the streets and halls of Caraskand.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Throughout the city, men began hunting cats, dogs, and finally even rats for sustenance. Poorer caste-nobles had taken to opening veins in their mounts. The horses themselves quickly consumed what thatched roofs could be found. Many bands began holding lotteries to see who would butcher their horse. Those without horses scratched through the dirt, looking for tubers. They boiled grapevines and even thistles to quiet the nagging madness of their bellies. Leather—from saddles, jerkins, or elsewhere—was also boiled and consumed. When the horns sounded the harnesses of many would swing like skirts, having lost their straps and buckles to some steaming pot. Gaunt men roamed the streets, looking for anything to eat, their faces blank, their movements sluggish, as though they walked through sand. Rumours circulated of men feasting on the bloated corpses of the Kianene, or committing murder in the dead of night to quiet their mad hunger.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">In the wake of Famine, foul Disease returned, preying on the weak. Men, particularly among the caste-menials, began losing teeth to scurvy. Dysentery punished others with cramps and bloody diarrhea. In many quarters, one could find warriors wandering without their breeches, wallowing, as some are wont to do, in their degradation.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">During this time, the furor surrounding Kellhus, Prince of Atrithau, and the tensions between those who acclaimed him and those who condemned him, escalated. In Council, Conphas, Gothyelk, and even Gotian relentlessly denounced him, claiming he was a False Prophet, a cancer that must be excised from the Holy War. Who could doubt the God punished them? The Holy War, they insisted, could have only one Prophet, and his name was Inri Sejenus. Proyas, who’d once eloquently defended Kellhus, withdrew from all such debates, and refused to say anything. Only Saubon still spoke in his favour, though he did so half-heartedly, not wishing to alienate those whose approval he needed to secure his claim to Caraskand.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Despite this, none dared move against the so-called Warrior-Prophet. His followers, the Zaudunyani, numbered in the tens of thousands, though they were less numerous among the upper castes. Many still remembered the Miracle of Water in the desert, how Kellhus had saved the Holy War, including those miscreants who now called him anathema. Strife and riot broke out, and for the first time Inrithi swords shed Inrithi blood. Knights repudiated their lords. Brothers forsook brothers. Countrymen turned upon one another. Only Gotian and Conphas, it seemed, were able to command the loyalty of their men.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Nevertheless, when the horns sounded, the Inrithi forgot their differences. They roused themselves from the torpor of disease and sickness, and they battled with a fervour only those truly wracked by the God could know. And to the heathens who assailed them, it seemed dead men defended the walls. Safe about their fires, the Kianene whispered tales of wights and damned souls, of a Holy War that had already perished, but fought on, such was its hate.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Caraskand, it seemed, named not a city, but misery’s own precinct. Her very walls—walls raised by Triamis the Great—seemed to groan.</span></div>
<div class="calibre2"><img alt="134" src="images/00135.jpg" class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<div class="calibre13"><span class="calibre8">The luxury of the place reminded Serwë of her indolent days as a concubine in House Gaunum. Through the open colonnade on the far side of the room she could see Caraskand wander across the hills beneath the sky. She was reclined on a green couch, her arms drawn out of her gown’s shoulders so that it hung from the gorgeous sash about her waist. Her pink son squirmed against her naked chest, and she had just begun feeding when she heard the latch drawn. She had expected it to be one of the Kianene house slaves, so she gasped in surprise and delight when she felt the Warrior-Prophet’s hand about her bare neck. The other brushed her bare breast as he reached to draw a gentle finger along the infant’s chubby back.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“What are you doing here?” she asked, as she raised her lips through his beard to give him a kiss.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Much happens,” he said gently. “I wanted to know you were safe … Where’s Esmi?”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">It always seemed so strange to hear him ask such simple questions. It reminded her that the God was still a man. “Kellhus,” she asked pensively, “what’s your father’s name?”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Moënghus.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Serwë furrowed her brow. “I thought his name was … Aethel, or something like that.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Aethelarius,” the Warrior-Prophet said. “In Atrithau, Kings take a great ancestor’s name when they ascend the throne. Moënghus is his true name.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Then,” she said, running fingers over the fuzz of the infant’s pale scalp, “that’s what his name will be when he’s anointed: <span class="italic">Moënghus</span>.” This wasn’t an assertion. In the Warrior-Prophet’s presence all declarations became questions.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Kellhus grinned. “That’s what we shall name our child.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“What kind of man is your father, my Prophet?”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“A most mysterious one, Serwë.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Serwë laughed softly. “Does he know that he fathered the voice of the God?”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Kellhus pursed his lips in mock concentration. “Perhaps.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Serwë, who’d grown accustomed to cryptic conversations such as this, smiled. She blinked at the tears in her eyes. With her child warm against her breast, and the breath of the Prophet warmer still across her neck, the World seemed a closed circle, as though woe had been exiled from joy at long last. No longer taxed by cruel and distant things, the hearth now answered to the heart.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">A sudden pang of guilt struck her. “I know that you grieve,” she said. “So many suffer …”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">He lowered his face. Said nothing.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“But I’ve never been so happy,” she continued. “So whole … Is that a sin? To find rapture where others suffer?”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Not for you, Serwë. Not for you.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Serwë gasped and looked down at her suckling babe.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Moënghus is hungry,” she laughed.</span></div>
<div class="calibre2"><img alt="135" src="images/00136.jpg" class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<div class="calibre13"><span class="calibre8">Glad to have concluded their long search, Rash and Wrigga paused along the crest of the wall. Dropping his shield, Rash sat with his back to the parapet, while Wrigga stood, leaning against the stonework, staring through an embrasure at the fires of the enemy across the Tertae Plain. Neither man paid heed to the shadowy figure crouched beneath the battlements farther down.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“I saw the child,” Wrigga said, still staring into the dark.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Did you?” Rash asked with genuine interest. “Where?”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Before the lower gates of the Fama Palace. The Anointing was public … You didn’t know, did you?”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Because no one tells me anything!”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Wrigga resumed his scrutiny of the night. “Surprisingly dark, I thought.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“What?”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“The child. The child seemed so dark.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Rash snorted. “Birth hair … It’ll soon fall out. I swear my second daughter had sideburns!”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Friendly laughter. “Someday, when all this is over, I’ll come and woo your hairy daughters.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Please … Start with my hairy wife!”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">More laughter, choked by a sudden realization. “Oh ho! So that’s how you got your nickname!”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Saucy bastard!” Rash cried. “<span class="italic">No,</span> my skin’s just—”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“The child’s name,” a voice grated from the darkness. “What is it?”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Both men started, turned to the towering spectre of the Scylvendi. They’d seen the man before—few Men of the Tusk hadn’t—but neither had ever found themselves so close to the barbarian. Even in moonlight, his aspect was unnerving. The wild black hair. The fuming brow above eyes like chips of ice. The powerful shoulders, faintly stooped, as though bent by the preternatural strength of his back. The lean, adolescent waist. And the arms, thatched by scars both ritual and incidental, strapped by unfatted muscle. He seemed a thing of stone, ancient and famished.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Wh-what’s this?” Rash stammered.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“The name!” Cnaiür snarled. “What did they name it?”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Moënghus!” Wrigga blurted. “They anointed him by the name, Moënghus …”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">The air of menace suddenly vanished. The barbarian became curiously blank, motionless to the point where he seemed inanimate. His manic eyes looked through them, to places far and forbidding.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">A taut moment passed, then without a word, the Scylvendi turned and walked into the darkness.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Sighing, the two men looked to each other for what seemed a long time, then just to be certain, they resumed their fabricated conversation.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">As they’d been instructed.</span></div>
<div class="calibre2"><img alt="136" src="images/00137.jpg" class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<div class="calibre13"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">Some other way, Father. There must be.</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">No one came to the Citadel of the Dog, not even the most desperate of the rat eaters.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Standing high upon the crest of a ruined wall, Kellhus gazed across the dark expanse of Caraskand with her thousand points of smouldering light. Beyond the walls, particularly across the plains to the north, he could see the innumerable fires of the Padirajah’s army.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">The path, Father … Where’s the path?</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">No matter how many times he submitted to the rigours of the Probability Trance, all the lines were extinguished, either by disaster or by the weight of excessive permutations. The variables were too many, the possibilities too precipitous.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Over the past weeks he’d exerted whatever influence he’d possessed, hoping to circumvent what now seemed more and more inevitable. Of the Great Names, only Saubon still openly supported him. Though Proyas had so far refused to join Conphas’s coalition of caste-nobles, the Conriyan Prince continued to rebuff Kellhus’s every overture. Among the lesser Men of the Tusk, the divisions between the Zaudunyani and the Orthodox, as they were now calling themselves, were deepening. And the threat of further, more determined attacks by the Consult made it impossible for him to move freely among them—as he must to secure those he already possessed and to conquer those he did not.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Meanwhile, the Holy War died.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">You told me mine was the Shortest Path</span> … He’d relived his brief encounter with the Cishaurim messenger a thousand times, analyzing, evaluating, weighing alternate interpretations—all for naught. Every step was darkness now, no matter what his father said. Every word was risk. In so many ways, it seemed, he was no different from these world-born men …</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">What is the Thousandfold Thought?</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">He heard the rattle of rock against rock, then a small cascade of gravel and grit. He peered through the shadows amassed about the ruin’s roots. The blasted walls formed a roofless labyrinth beyond the Nail of Heaven’s pale reach. A darker shadow clambered across heaped debris. He glimpsed a round face in starlight …</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">He called down. “Esmenet? How did you find me?”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Her grin was pure mischief, though Kellhus could see the concern beneath.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">She’s never loved another as she loves me. Not even Achamian.</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Werjau told me,” she said, picking her way up and along the truncated wall.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Ah, yes,” Kellhus said, understanding immediately. “He fears women.” Esmenet wobbled for a moment, threw out her arms. She caught herself, but not before Kellhus found himself puzzled by a sudden shortness of breath. The fall would have been fatal.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“No …” She concentrated for a moment, her tongue between her lips. Then she danced up the remaining length. “He fears <span class="italic">me!</span>” She threw herself into his arms, laughing. They held each other tight on the dark and windy heights, surrounded by a city and a world—by Caraskand and the Three Seas.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">She knows … She knows I struggle.</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“We all fear you,” Kellhus said, wondering at the clamminess of his skin.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">She comes to comfort.</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“You tell such delicious lies,” she murmured, raising her lips to his.</span></div>
<div class="calibre2"><img alt="137" src="images/00138.jpg" class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<div class="calibre13"><span class="calibre8">They arrived shortly after dusk, the nine Nascenti, the senior disciples of the Warrior-Prophet. A grand teak-and-mahogany table, no higher than their knees, had been pulled onto the terrace of the merchant palace Kellhus had taken as their base and refuge in Caraskand. Standing unnoticed in the shadows of the garden, Esmenet watched them as they knelt or sat cross-legged upon the cushions set about the table. These days worry lined the faces of most everyone, but the nine of them seemed particularly upset. The Nascenti spent their time in the city, organizing the Zaudunyani, consecrating new Judges, and laying the foundation of the Ministrate. They knew better than most, she imagined, the straits of the Holy War.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Raised about the northern face of the Heights of the Bull, the terrace overlooked a greater part of the city. The labyrinthine streets and byways of the Bowl, which formed the heart of Caraskand, ascended into the distance, hanging from the surrounding heights like a cloth draped between five stumps. The ruined shell of the Citadel reared to the east, the wandering lines of her blasted walls etched in moonlight. To the northwest, the Sapatishah’s Palace sprawled across the Kneeling Heights, which were low enough to afford glimpses of lamp-lit figures over rose marble walls. The night sky was rutted by black clouds, but the Nail of Heaven was clear, brilliant, sparkling from the dark depths of the firmament.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">A sudden hush fell across the Nascenti; as one they lowered their chins to their breast. Turning, Esmenet saw Kellhus stride from the golden interior of the adjacent apartments. He cast a fan of shadows before him as he walked past a row of flaming braziers. Two bare-chested Kianene boys flanked him, bearing censers that boiled with steely blue smoke. Serwë followed in his train, along with several men in hauberks and battle helms.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Esmenet cursed herself for catching her breath. How could he make her heart pound so? Glancing down, she realized she’d folded her right hand over the tattoo marring the back of her left.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">Those days are over.</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">She stepped from the garden and greeted him at the head of the table. He smiled, and holding the fingers of her left hand, seated her to his immediate right. His white silk robe swayed in the breeze that touched them all, and for some reason, the Twin Scimitars embroidered about its hems and cuffs did not seem incongruous in the least. Someone, Serwë likely, had knotted his hair into a Galeoth war braid. His beard, which he now wore plaited and square-cut like the Ainoni, gleamed bronze in the light of nearby braziers. As always, the long pommel of his sword jutted high over his left shoulder. Enshoiya, the Zaudunyani now called it: Certainty.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">His eyes twinkled beneath heavy brows. When he smiled, nets of wrinkles flexed about the corners of his eyes and mouth—a gift of the desert sun.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“You,” he said, “are branches of me.” His voice was deep and manytimbred, and somehow seemed to speak from her breast. “Of all peoples only you know what comes before. Only you, the Thanes of the Warrior-Prophet, know what moves you.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">While he briefed the Nascenti on those matters he and she had already discussed, Esmenet found herself thinking about Xinemus’s camp, about the differences between those gatherings and these. Mere months had passed, and yet it seemed she’d lived an entire life in the interim. She frowned at the strangeness of it: Xinemus holding court, calling out in mirth and mischief; Achamian squeezing her hand too tightly, as he sometimes did, searching for her eyes too often; and Kellhus with Serwë … still little more than a promise, though it seemed Esmenet had loved him even then—secretly.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">For some strange reason, she was overcome by a sudden yen to see the Marshal’s wry Captain, Bloody Dench. She remembered her final glimpse of him, as he waited with Zenkappa for Xinemus to rejoin them, his short-cropped hair silver in the Shigeki sun. How black those days now seemed. How heartless and cruel.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">What had happened to Dinchases? And Xinemus …</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Had he found Achamian?</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">She suffered a moment of gaping horror … Kellhus’s melodic voice retrieved her.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“If anything should happen,” he was saying, “you shall hearken to Esmenet as you hearken to me …”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">For I’m his vessel.</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">The words triggered an exchange of worried looks. Esmenet could read the sentiment well enough: what could the Master mean, placing a woman before his Holy Thanes? Even after all this time, they still struggled with the darkness of their origins. They had not utterly embraced him, as she had …</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">Old bigotries die hard,</span> she thought with more than a little resentment.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“But Master,” Werjau, the boldest among them, said, “you speak as though you might be taken from us!”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">A heartbeat passed before she realized her mistake: what worried them was what his words <span class="italic">implied,</span> not the prospect of subordinating themselves to his Consort.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Kellhus was silent for a long moment. He looked gravely from face to face. “War is upon us,” he said finally, “from both without and within.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Even though she and Kellhus had already discussed the danger he spoke of, chills pimpled her skin. Cries erupted around the table. Esmenet felt Serwë’s hands clasp about her own. She turned to reassure the girl, only to realize that Serwë had reached to reassure <span class="italic">her. Just listen,</span> the girl’s beautiful eyes said. The lunatic dimensions of Serwë’s belief had always baffled and troubled Esmenet. The girl’s conviction was more than monumental—it seemed continuous with the ground, it was so immovable.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">She let me into her bed,</span> Esmenet thought. <span class="italic">For love of him</span>.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Who assails us?” Gayamakri was crying.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Conphas,” Werjau spat. “Who else? He’s been working against us since Shigek …”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Then we must strike!” white-haired Kasaumki shouted. “The Holy War must be cleansed before the siege can be broken! Cleansed!”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Errant madness!” Hilderuth barked. “We must negotiate … You must go to them, Master.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Kellhus silenced them with little more than a look.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">It frightened her, sometimes, the way he effortlessly commanded these men. But then it could be no other way. Where others blundered from moment to moment, scarcely understanding their own wants, hurts, or hopes, let alone those of others, Kellhus caught each instant—each soul—like a fly. His world, Esmenet had realized, was one without surfaces, one where everything—from word and expression to war and nation—was smoky glass, something to be peered <span class="italic">through</span> …</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">He was the Warrior-Prophet … Truth. And Truth commanded all things.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">She quashed a sudden urge to hug herself in joy and astonishment. She was here—<span class="italic">here!</span>—at the right hand of the most glorious soul to have walked the world. To kiss Truth. To take Truth between her thighs, to feel him press deep into her womb. It was more than a boon, more than a gift …</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“She smiles,” Werjau exclaimed. “How can she smile at a time such as this?”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Esmenet glanced at the burly Galeoth, flushing in embarrassment.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Because,” Kellhus said indulgently, “she sees what you cannot, Werjau.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">But Esmenet wasn’t so sure … She simply daydreamed, didn’t she? Werjau had simply caught her mooning over Kellhus like an addled juvenile …</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">But then, why did the ground thrum so? And the stars … What <span class="italic">did</span> she see?</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">Something … Something without compare.</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Her skin tingled. The Thanes of the Warrior-Prophet watched her, and she looked through their faces, glimpsed their yearning hearts. To think! So many deluded souls, living illusory lives in unreal worlds! So many! It both boggled her and broke her heart.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">And at the same time, it was her triumph.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">Something absolute.</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Her heart fluttered, pinioned by Kellhus’s shining gaze. She felt at once smoke and naked flesh—something seen through and something desired.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">There’s more than me … More than this—yes!</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Tell us, Esmi,” Kellhus hissed through Serwë’s mouth. “Tell us what you see!”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">There’s more than</span> them.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“We must take the knife to them,” she said, speaking as she knew her Master would have her speak. “We must show them the demons in their midst.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">So much more!</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">The Warrior-Prophet smiled with her own lips.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“We must kill them,” her voice said.</span></div>
<div class="calibre2"><img alt="138" src="images/00139.jpg" class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<div class="calibre13"><span class="calibre8">The thing called Sarcellus hurried through the dark streets toward the hill where the Exalt-General and his Columns had quartered. The letter Conphas had sent was simple: <span class="italic">Come quickly. Danger stalks us</span>. The man had neglected to sign the letter, but then he didn’t need to. His meticulous handwriting was unmistakable.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Sarcellus turned down a narrow street that smelled of unwashed Men and animal grease. More derelict Inrithi, he realized. As the Holy War starved, more and more Men of the Tusk had turned to an animal existence, hunting rats, eating things that should not be eaten, and begging …</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">The starving wretches came to their feet as he walked between them. They congregated about him, holding out filthy palms, tugging at his sleeves. <span class="italic">“Mercy …”</span> they moaned and muttered. <span class="italic">“Merceeee.”</span> Sarcellus thrust them back, made his way forward. He struck several of the more insistent. Not that he begrudged them, for they’d often proved useful when the hunger grew too great. No one missed beggars.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Besides, they were apt reminders of what Men were in truth.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Pale hands reached from looted silks. Piteous cries seethed through the gloom. Then, in the gravelly voice of a drunkard, a rag-draped man before him said, “Truth shines.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Excuse me?” Sarcellus snapped, coming to a halt.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">He seized the speaker by the shoulders, jerked his head up. Though bitten, the man’s face hadn’t been battered into submission—far from it. His eyes looked hard as iron. This, Sarcellus realized, was a man who <span class="italic">battered</span>.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Truth,” the man said, “does not die.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“What’s this?” Sarcellus asked, releasing the warrior. “Robbery?”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">The iron-eyed man shook his head.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Ah,” Sarcellus said, suddenly understanding. “You belong to him … What is it you call yourselves?”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Zaudunyani.” The man smiled, and for a moment, it seemed the most terrifying smile Sarcellus had ever witnessed: pale lips pressed into a thin, passionless line.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Then Sarcellus remembered the purpose of his fashioning. How could he forget what he was? His phallus hardened against his breeches …</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Slaves of the Warrior-Prophet,” he said, sneering. “Tell me, do you know <span class="italic">what</span> I am?”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Dead,” someone said from behind.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Sarcellus laughed, sweeping his gaze over the necks he would break. Oh, rapture! How he would shoot hot across his thigh! He was certain of it!</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">Yes! With so many! This time …</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">But his humour vanished when his look returned to the man with the iron eyes. The face beneath his face twitched into a vestigial frown … <span class="italic">They’re not af—</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Something rained down from above … Suddenly he found himself drenched. Oil! They’d doused him in oil! He looked from side to side, blowing fluid from his lips, shaking it from his fingertips. His would-be assassins, he saw, had been doused as well.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Fools!” he exclaimed. “Burn me, and you burn too!”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">At the last instant, Sarcellus heard the bowstring twang, the flaming arrow zip through the air. He jerked to the side. The shaft struck the iron-eyed man. Flame leapt up his soiled robes, twined about his cowl.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">But rather than fall, the man lunged, his eyes fixed upon Sarcellus, his arms closing in an embrace. The shaft snapped between them. Burning breast met burning breast.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Flame consumed them both. The thing called Sarcellus howled, shrieked with its entire face. It stared in horror at the iron eyes, now wreathed in blazing fire …</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Truth …” the man whispered.</span></div>
<div class="calibre2"><img alt="139" src="images/00140.jpg" class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<div class="calibre13"><span class="calibre8">Ikurei Conphas. How like a child he looked, his naked form half-twisted in sheets, his face tipped gently back, as though he peered into some distant sky in his dreams. General Martemus stood in the shadows, gazing down at the sleeping form of his Exalt-General, silently rehearsing the command that had brought him here—knife in hand.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">“Tonight, Martemus, I will reach out my hand …”</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">It was unlike any he’d ever been given.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Martemus had spent most of his life following commands, and though he’d unstintingly tried to execute each and every one, even those that proved disastrous, their origins had always haunted him. No matter how tormented or august the channels, the commands he followed had always come from <span class="italic">somewhere,</span> from someplace within a beaten and debauched world: peevish officers, spiteful apparati, vainglorious generals … As a result, he had often thought that thought, so catastrophic for a man who’d been bred to serve: <span class="italic">I am greater than what I obey.</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">But the command he followed this night …</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">“Tonight, Martemus …”</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">It came from nowhere within the circle of this world.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">“I will take a life.”</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">To answer such a command, he’d decided, was more than merely akin to worship—it was worship made flesh. All meaningful things, it now seemed to him, were but forms of prayer.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Lessons of the Warrior-Prophet.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Martemus raised the silvery blade to a shaft of moonlight, and for a shining moment it seemed to <span class="italic">fit</span> Conphas’s throat. In his soul’s eye, he saw the Imperial Heir dead, beautiful lips perched open in the memory of a final breath, glassy eyes staring far, far into the Outside. He saw blood pooled in folded linen sheets, like water between the petals of a lotus. The General glanced about the luxurious bedchamber, at the dim frescoes prancing along the walls, at the dark carpets swimming across the floor. Would it seem a simpler place, he wondered, when they found his corpse in blooded sheets?</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Commands. Through them a voice could become an army, a breath could become blood.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">Think of how long you’ve wanted this!</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Dread and exhilaration.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">You’re a practical man. Strike and be done with it!</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Conphas groaned, shifted like a naked virgin beneath the sheets. His eyes fluttered open. Stared at him in dull incomprehension. Flickered to the accusatory knife.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Martemus?” the young man gasped.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Truth,” the General grated, striking downward.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">But there was a flash, and though his arm continued arcing downward, his hand tumbled outward, the knife slipping from nerveless fingers. Dumbstruck, he raised his arm, stared in horror at the stump of his wrist. Blood spilled along the back of his forearm, dribbled like piss from his elbow.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">He whirled to the shadows, saw the glistening demon, its skin puckered by hell-fire, its face impossibly extended, clawing the air like a crab …</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Fucking Dûnyain,” it growled.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Something passed through Martemus’s neck. Something sharp …</span></div>
<div class="calibre2"><img alt="140" src="images/00141.jpg" class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<div class="calibre13"><span class="calibre8">Martemus’s head bounced from the side of the mattress into the shadows, a living expression still flexing across its face. Too horrified to cry out, Conphas scrambled through the tangled sheets, away from the figure that had killed his General. The form backed into the blackness of a far corner, but for an instant Conphas glimpsed something naked and nightmarish—something impossible.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Who?” he cried.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Silence!” a familiar voice hissed. “It’s <span class="italic">me!</span>”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Sarcellus?”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">The horror slackened somewhat. But the bewilderment remained …</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">Martemus dead?</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“This is a nightmare!” Conphas exclaimed. “I still sleep!”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“You don’t sleep, I assure you. Though you came close to never awakening …”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“What happens?” Conphas cried. Despite hollow legs, he strode around the far mahogany post of his bed, stood naked over the crumpled form of his General. The man still wore his field uniform. “Martemus?”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Belonged to <span class="italic">him,</span>” the voice from the dark corner said.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Prince Kellhus,” Conphas said in dawning recognition. Suddenly he understood all that he needed to know: a battle had just been fought—and won. He grinned in relief—and wondrous admiration. The man had used Martemus! <span class="italic">Martemus!</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">And here I thought I’d won the battle for his soul!</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“I need a lantern,” he snapped, recovering his imperious mien. What was that smell?</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Strike no light!” the disembodied voice cried. “They attacked me tonight as well.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Conphas scowled. Saviour or not, Sarcellus had no business barking commands at his betters.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“As you can see,” he said graciously, so as not to imply ingratitude, “my most trusted General is dead. I will have light.” He turned to call for his guards …</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Don’t be a fool! We must act fast, otherwise the Holy War is doomed!”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Conphas paused, looked to the corner concealing the Shrial Knight, his head tilted in morbid curiosity. “They burned you, didn’t they?” He took two steps toward the shadows. “You smell of pork.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">There was a rattle, like that of a bolting beast, and something slick barrelled across the bedchamber, disappeared out the balcony …</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Roaring for his guards, Conphas raced after him, waving past the gossamer sheers. Though he saw nothing in the Caraskand night, he noticed the spray of Martemus’s blood across his arms. He heard his guards explode into the room behind him, grinned at their shouts of dismay.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“General Martemus,” he called, stepping out of the chill air into their astonished presence, “was a traitor. Bring his body to the engines. See that it’s cast to the heathens, where it belongs. Then send for General Sompas.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">The truce had ended.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“And the General’s head,” his towering Captain, Triaxeras, asked in an unsteady voice, “do you wish that cast to the heathens as well?”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“No,” Ikurei Conphas said, slipping into a robe held out by one of his haeturi. He laughed at the absurdity of the man’s head, which lay like a cabbage near the foot of his bed. It was odd how he could feel so little after all they’d suffered together.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“The General never leaves my side, Triah. You know that.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre2"><img alt="141" src="images/00142.jpg" class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<div class="calibre13"><span class="calibre8">Fustaras was a zealous soldier. As a Proadjunct in the third maniple of the Selial Column, he was what others in the Imperial Army called a “Threesie,” someone who’d signed a third indenture—a third fourteen-year term—rather than taking his Imperial Pension. Though often the bane of junior officers, Threesies like Fustaras were prized by their generals, so much so they were often issued more shares than their titular superiors. Everyone knew Threesies formed the stubborn heart of any Column. They were the men who saw things through.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Which was why, Fustaras supposed, General Sompas had chosen him and several of his fellows for this mission. “When children go astray,” the man had said, “they must be beaten.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Dressed, like most Men of the Tusk, in looted Kianene robes, Fustaras and his band prowled the street commonly known as the Galleries—so named, Fustaras supposed, because of the innumerable, tenement-lined alleyways that wound about it. Located in the southeast quarter of the Bowl, it was a notorious gathering place for the Zaudunyani—the cursed heretics. Many would crowd the tenement rooftops and call out prayers to the nearby Heights of the Bull, where that obscene fraud, Prince Kellhus of Atrithau, continued to cower. Others would listen to deranged enthusiasts—they called them Judges—preach from the mouth of various alleyways.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Following his instructions to the letter, Fustaras halted and accosted a Judge where the heretics were most concentrated. “Tell me, friend,” he asked in an amiable manner. “What do they say of Truth?”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">The emaciated man turned, his pate gleaming pink through a froth of wild, white hair. Without hesitation, he replied, “That it shines.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">As though reaching for coppers to toss to beggars, Fustaras clasped the ash club hanging beneath his cloak. “Are you sure?” he asked, his demeanour at once casual and dangerous. He hefted the polished haft. “Perhaps it bleeds.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">The man’s sparkling gaze darted from Fustaras’s eyes to the club, then back. “That too,” he said in the rigid manner of someone resolved to master their quailing heart. He pitched his voice so those nearby could hear. “If not, then why the Holy War?”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">This particular heretic, Fustaras decided, was too clever by a half. He hoisted the club high, then struck. The man fell to one knee. Blood trickled across his right temple and cheek; he raised two glistening fingers to Fustaras, as though to say, <span class="italic">See</span> …</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Fustaras struck him again. The Judge fell to the cracked cobble.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Shouts echoed through the street, and Fustaras glimpsed half-starved men running from all directions. Clubs bared, his troop closed in formation about him. Even so, he found himself reconsidering the merits of the General’s plan … There were so many. How could there be so many?</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Then he remembered he was a Threesie.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">He wiped the flecks of blood from his face with a stained sleeve. “To all those who heed the so-called Warrior-Prophet,” he cried. “Know that we, the Orthodox, will doom you as you have doomed—”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Something exploded against his jaw. He pitched backward, clutching his face, stumbled over the inert form of the Judge. He rolled across the hard ground, felt blood pulse over his fingertips. A rock … Someone had thrown a rock!</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">His ears ringing, clamour roaring about him, he pressed himself to one knee, then found his feet. Clutching his jaw, he stood, looked around … and saw his men being cut down. Terror bolted through him.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">But the general said—</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">A wild-eyed Thunyeri with three shrivelled Sranc heads jangling between his thighs reached out and seized him by the throat. For an instant, the man looked scarcely human, he was so tall and so thin.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">“Reära thuning praussa!”</span> the flaxen-haired barbarian roared, swinging him about. Fustaras glimpsed armed shadows behind, felt his cry gagged into a cough by the thumb crushing his windpipe. <span class="italic">“Fraas kaumrut!”</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">There was an instant where he could actually feel the cold of the iron spear tip against the small of his back. A sensation, like sucking deep icy air. Howling faces. The hot rush of blood.</span></div>
<div class="calibre2"><img alt="142" src="images/00143.jpg" class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<div class="calibre13"><span class="calibre8">A wheezing, huffing animal ruled its black heart, mewling in pain and fury.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">The thing called Sarcellus shuffled through the ruined precincts of some nameless tabernacle. For three days it had skulked through the dark places of the city, unable to close its face for pain. Now, kicking through a clutch of blackened human skulls, it thought of the snow that whistled across the Plains of Agongorea, of white expanses bruised black by pitch. It could remember leaping through the cool cool drifts, soothed rather than bitten by the icy winds. It could remember blood jetting across pristine white, fading into lines of rose.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">But the snow was so very far—as far as Holy Golgotterath!—and the fire, it flared as near as his blistered skin. The fire still burned!</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">Curse-him-curse-him-curse-him-curse-him! Let me gnaw his tongue! Fuck his wounds!</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Do you suffer, Gaörta?”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">It jerked like a cat, peered through the cramped digits of its outer face.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">As still and glossy black as a statue of diorite, the Synthese regarded him from the summit of several heaped and charred bodies. Its face looked white and wet and inscrutable in the gloom, like something carved from a potato.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">The shell of the Old Father … Aurang, Great General of the World-Breaker, ancient Prince of the Inchoroi.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“It <span class="italic">hurts,</span> Old Father! <span class="italic">How it hurts!</span>”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Savour it, Gaörta, for it’s but a taste of what is to come.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">The thing called Sarcellus snuffled and blubbered, rolled its inner and outer faces beneath the merciless stars.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“<span class="italic">No,”</span> it moaned, beating petulant fingers through the debris at its feet. <span class="italic">“Nooo!”</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Yes,” the tiny lips said. “The Holy War is doomed … You have failed. <span class="italic">You,</span> Gaörta.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Wild terror lanced through its cringing thoughts: it knew what failure meant, but it couldn’t move. There was only obedience before the Architect, the Maker.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“But it wasn’t me! It was <span class="italic">them!</span> The Cishaurim command the Padirajah! It was their—”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“<span class="italic">Fault,</span> Gaörta?” the Old Father said. “The very poison we would suck from this world?”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">The thing called Sarcellus raised its hands in desperate warding. All the monstrous and monumental glory of the Consult seemed to crash down upon him. “I’m sorry, please!”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">The tiny eyes closed, but whether in weariness or in contemplation, the thing called Sarcellus could not tell. When they opened, they were as blue as cataracts. “One more task, Gaörta. One more task in the name of <span class="italic">spite</span>.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">It fell to its belly before the Synthese, writhed and grovelled in agony. “Anything!” it gasped. “Anything! I would cut out any heart! Pluck any eye! I would drag the whole world to oblivion!”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“The Holy War is doomed. We must deal with the Cishaurim some other way …” Again, the eyes clicked shut. “You must ensure this Kellhus dies with the Men of the Tusk. He must not escape.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">And the thing called Sarcellus forgot about snow. Vengeance! Vengeance would balm his blasted skin!</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">“Now,”</span> the palm-sized expression grated, and Gaörta had the sense of vast power, ancient and hoary, forced through a reed throat. Here and there, small showers of dust trailed down the broken walls.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Close your face.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Gaörta obeyed as he must, screamed as he must.</span></div>
<div class="calibre2"><img alt="143" src="images/00144.jpg" class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<div class="calibre13"><span class="calibre8">Proyas’s missive crumpled in his right hand, Cnaiür strode through a carpeted corridor belonging to the humble but strategically located villa where the Conriyan had chosen to sequester his household—or what remained of it. He paused before entering the bright square of the courtyard, stooping beneath the florid double-arched vaults peculiar to Kianene architecture. A dried orange peel, no longer than his thumb, lay curled in the dust encircling the black marble base of the left pilaster. Without thinking, he scooped it into his mouth, winced at the bitterness.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Every day he grew more hungry.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">My son! How could he so name my son?</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">He found Proyas awaiting him near one of three brackish pools at the centre of the courtyard, loitering with two men he didn’t recognize: an imperial officer and a Shrial Knight. Mid-morning clouds formed a ponderous procession across the sky, drawing their shadows across the sun-bright confusion of the hills that loomed over the courtyard’s shaded porticos, particularly to the south and west.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Caraskand. The city that had become their tomb.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">He does this to gall me. To remind me of the object of my hate!</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Proyas caught sight of him first. “Cnaiür, good—”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“I don’t read,” he growled, tossing the crumpled sheaf at the Prince’s feet. “If you wish to confer with me, send <span class="italic">word,</span> not scratches.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Proyas’s expression darkened. “But of course,” he said tightly. He nodded to the two strangers, as though trying to salvage some rigid semblance of jnanic decorum. “These men have made a claim—of sorts—in a bid to secure my support. I would have you confirm it.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Struck by a sudden horror, Cnaiür stared at the imperial officer, recognizing the insignia stamped into the collar of his cuirass. And of course, there was the blue mantle …</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">The man frowned, exchanged a smiling, significant look with his companion.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“He grows lean in wits as well,” the officer said in a voice Cnaiür recognized all too well. He suddenly remembered it floating across the corpses of his kinsmen—at the Battle of Kiyuth. Ikurei Conphas … The Exalt-General stood before him! But how could he fail to recognize him?</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">But the madness lifts! It lifts!</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Cnaiür blinked, saw himself seated upon Conphas’s chest, carving off his nose the way a child might draw in the mud. “What does he want?” he barked at Proyas. He glanced at the Shrial Knight, realizing he’d seen the man before as well, though he couldn’t recall his name. A small, golden Tusk hung about the Knight-Commander’s neck, cupped in the folds of his white surcoat.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Conphas answered in Proyas’s stead. “What I want, you barbaric lout, is the <span class="italic">truth</span>.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“The truth?”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Lord Sarcellus,” Proyas said, “claims to have news of Atrithau.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Cnaiür stared at the man, for the first time noticing the bandages about his hands and the odd network of angry red lines across his sumptuous face. “Atrithau? But how is that possible?”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Three men have come forward,” Sarcellus said, “out of the piety of their hearts. They swear that a man—a veteran of the northern caravans who perished in the desert—told them there was no way Prince Kellhus could be who he claims to be.” The Shrial Knight smiled in a peculiar fashion—obviously the burns, or whatever marred his face, were quite painful. “Apparently the scandal of Atrithau,” Sarcellus continued inexorably, “is that its King, Aethelarius, has <span class="italic">no live heirs</span>. The House of Morghund is about to flicker out—forever, they say. And this means that Anasûrimbor Kellhus is a pretender.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">The faint throb of Kianene drums filled the silence. Cnaiür turned back to Proyas. “You said they want your support … For what?”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Just answer the blasted question!” Conphas exclaimed.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Ignoring the Exalt-General, Cnaiür and Proyas exchanged a look of honesty and admission. Despite their quarrels, such looks had become frighteningly common over the course of the past weeks.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“With my support,” Proyas said, “they think they can prosecute Kellhus without inciting war within these cursed walls.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Prosecute Kellhus?”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Yes … As a False Prophet, according to the Law of the Tusk.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Cnaiür scowled. “And why do you need my word?”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Because I trust you.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Cnaiür swallowed. <span class="italic">Outland dogs!</span> someone raged. <span class="italic">Kine!</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">For some reason a look of alarm flickered across Conphas’s face.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Apparently the illustrious Prince of Conriya,” Sarcellus said, “will have no truck with hearsay …”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Not,” Proyas snapped, “on a matter as ill-omened as this!”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Working his jaw, Cnaiür glared at the Shrial Knight, wondering what could cause such a strange disposition of burns across a man’s face. He thought of the Battle of Anwurat, of the relish with which he’d driven his knife into Kellhus’s chest—or the thing that had looked like him. He thought of Serwë gasping beneath him, and a pang watered his eyes. Only she knew his heart. Only she understood when he awoke weeping …</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Serwë, first wife of his heart.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">I will have her!</span> someone within him wept. <span class="italic">She belongs to me!</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">So beautiful … <span class="italic">My proof!</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Suddenly everything seemed to slump, as though the world itself had been soaked in numbness and lead. And he realized—without anguish, without heartbreak—that Anasûrimbor Moënghus was beyond him. Despite all his hate, all his tooth-gnashing fury, the blood trail he followed ended here … In a city.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">We’re dead. All of us …</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">If Caraskand was to be their tomb, he would see certain blood spilled first.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">But Moënghus!</span> someone cried. <span class="italic">Moënghus must die!</span> And yet he could no longer recall the hated face. He saw only a mewling infant …</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“What you say is true,” he finally said. He turned to Proyas, held his astonished, brown-eyed gaze. It seemed he could taste the orange peel anew, so bitter were the words.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“The man you call Prince Kellhus is an imposter … A prince of nothing.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre2"><img alt="144" src="images/00145.jpg" class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<div class="calibre13"><span class="calibre8">Never, it seemed, had his heart felt so flaccid and cold.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">The many-pillared audience hall of the Sapatishah’s Palace was as immense as old King Eryeat’s dank gallery in Moraör, the ancient Hall of Kings in Oswenta, and yet the glory of the Warrior-Prophet made it seem the hearth room of a hovel. Seated upon Imbeyan’s throne of ivory and bone, Saubon watched his approach with trepidation. Cupped in gigantic bowls of iron, the King-Fires crackled in his periphery. Even after all this time they seemed to offend the surrounding magnificence—the imposition of a crude and backward people.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">But still, he was King! King of Caraskand.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Draped in white samite, the man who’d once been Prince Kellhus paused beneath him, standing on the round crimson rug the Kianene had used for obeisance. He did not kneel, nor did he seem to blink.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Why have you summoned me?”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“To warn you … You must flee. The Council convenes shortly …”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“But the Padirajah commands the approaches, rules the countryside. Besides, I cannot abandon those who follow me. I cannot abandon you.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“But you must! They will condemn you. Even Proyas!”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“And you, Coithus Saubon? Will you condemn me?”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“No … Never!”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“But you’ve already given them your guarantees.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Who said this? What liar dares—”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“You. You say this.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“But … But you must understand!”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“I understand. They’ve ransomed your city. All you need do is pay.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“No! It’s not that way. It’s not!”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Then what way is it?”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“It … It … It is what it is!”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“For all of your life, Saubon, you’ve ached for <span class="italic">this,</span> the trappings of a tyrant—the effects of old Eryeat, your father. Tell me, to whom did you run, Saubon, after your father beat you? Who dabbed your cuts with fleece? Was it to your mother? Or was it to Kussalt, your groom?</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“No one beat me! He … He …”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Kussalt, then. Tell me, Saubon, what was more difficult? Losing him on the Plains of Mengedda, or learning of his lifelong hate?”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Silence!”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“All your long life, no one has known you.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Silence!”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“All your long life you’ve suffered, you’ve questioned—”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“No! No! Silence!”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“—and you’ve punished those who would love you.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Saubon slapped burly hands about his ears. “Cease! I command it!”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“As you punished Kussalt, as you punish—”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“<span class="italic">Silence-silence-silence!</span> They told me you would do this! They warned me!”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Indeed. They warned you against the <span class="italic">truth</span>. Against wandering into the nets of the Warrior-Prophet.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“How can you know this?” Saubon cried, overcome by incredulous woe. <span class="italic">“How?”</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Because it’s Truth.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Then fie on it! <span class="italic">Fie on the truth!</span>”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“And what of your immortal soul?”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Then let it be damned!” he roared, leaping to his feet. “I embrace it—embrace it all! Damnation in this life! Damnation in <span class="italic">all others!</span> Torment heaped upon torment! I would bear all to be King for a day! I would see you broken and blooded if that meant I could own this throne! <span class="italic">I would see the God’s own eyes plucked out!</span>”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">This last scream pealed through the hollow recesses of the audience hall, returned to him in a haunting shiver: <span class="italic">pluck-plucked-out-out</span> …</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">He fell to his knees before his throne, felt the heat of his King-Fires bite tear-soaked skin. There was shouting, the clank of armour and weaponry. Guards had come rushing …</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">But of the Warrior-Prophet there was no sign.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“He-he’s not real,” Saubon mumbled to the hollows of his court. “He doesn’t exist!”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">But the gold-ringed fists kept falling. They would never stop.</span></div>
<div class="calibre2"><img alt="145" src="images/00146.jpg" class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<div class="calibre13"><span class="calibre8">He’d spent days seated upon the terrace, lost in whatever worlds he searched in his trances. At sunrise and sunset, Esmenet would go to him and leave a bowl of water as he’d directed. She brought him food as well, though he’d asked her not to. She would stare at his broad, motionless back, at his hair waving in the breeze, at the dying sun upon his face, and she would feel like a little girl kneeling before an idol, offering tribute to something monstrous and insatiable: salted fish, dried prunes and figs, unleavened bread—enough to cause a small riot in the lower city.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">He touched none of it.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Then one dawn she went out to him, and he wasn’t there.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">After a desperate rush through the galleries of the palace, she found him in their apartments, unkempt and rakish, joking with Serwë, who had just arisen.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Esmi-Esmi-Esmi,” the swollen-eyed girl pouted. “Could you bring me little Moënghus?”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Too relieved to feel exasperated, Esmenet ducked into the adjoining nursery and plucked the black-haired babe from his cradle. Though his dumbfounded stare made her smile, she found the winter blue of his eyes unnerving.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“I was just saying,” Kellhus said as she delivered the child to Serwë, “that the Great Names have summoned me …” He reached out a haloed hand. “They want to parley.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">He mentioned nothing, of course, about his meditation. He never did.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Esmenet took his hand, sat beside him on their bed, only just understanding the implications of what he had said.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Parley?” she suddenly cried. “Kellhus, they summon you to <span class="italic">condemn you!</span>”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Kellhus?” Serwë asked. “What does she mean?”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“That this parley is a <span class="italic">trap,</span>” Esmenet exclaimed. She stared hard at Kellhus. “You know this!”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“What can you mean?” Serwë exclaimed. “Everyone loves Kellhus … Everyone <span class="italic">knows</span> now.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“No, Serwë. Many hate him—very many. Very many want him dead!”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Serwë laughed in the oblivious way of which only she seemed capable. “Esmenet …” she said, shaking her head as though at a beloved fool. She boosted little Moënghus into the air. “Auntie Esmi forgets,” she cooed to the infant. “Yeeesss. She forgets who your father is!”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Esmenet watched dumbstruck. Sometimes she wanted nothing more than to wring the girl’s neck. How? How could he love such a simpering fool?</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Esmi …” Kellhus said abruptly. The warning in his voice chilled her heart. She turned to him, shouted <span class="italic">Forgive me!</span> with her eyes.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">But at the same time, she couldn’t relent, not now, not after what she had found. “Tell her, Kellhus! Tell her what’s about to happen!”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">Not again. Not again!</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Listen to me, Esmi. There’s no other way. The Zaudunyani and the Orthodox cannot go to war.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Not even for you?” she cried. “This Holy War, this city, is but a pittance compared to you! Don’t you see, Kellhus?” Her desperation swelled into sudden anguish and desolation, and she angrily wiped at her tears. This was too important for selfish grief! <span class="italic">But I’ve lost so many!</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Don’t you see how precious you are? Think of what Akka said! What if you’re the world’s only hope?”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">He cupped her cheek, brushed her eyebrow with his thumb, which he held warm against her temple.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Sometimes, Esmi, we must cross death to reach our destination.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">She thought of King Shikol in <span class="italic">The Tractate,</span> the demented Xerashi King who’d commanded the Latter Prophet’s execution. She thought of his gilded thighbone, the instrument of judgement, which to this day remained the most potent symbol of evil in Inrithidom. Was this what Inri Sejenus had said to his nameless lover? That loss could somehow secure glory?</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">But this is madness!</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“The Shortest Path,” she said, horrified by the teary-eyed contemptuousness of her tone.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">But the blond-bearded face smiled.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Yes,” the Warrior-Prophet said. “The Logos.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre2"><img alt="146" src="images/00147.jpg" class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre4"> </div>
<div class="calibre13"><span class="calibre8">“Anasûrimbor Kellhus,” Gotian intoned in his powerful voice, “I hereby denounce you as a False Prophet, and as a pretender to the warrior-caste. It is the judgement of the Council of Great and Lesser Names that you be scourged in the manner decreed by Scripture.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Serwë heard a wail pierce the thunderous outcry, and only afterward realized that it was her own. Moënghus sobbed in her arms, and she reflexively began rocking him, though she was too frightened to coo reassurances. The Hundred Pillars had drawn their swords, and now thronged to either side of them, trading fierce glares with the Shrial Knights.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">“You judge no one!”</span> someone was bellowing. <span class="italic">“The Warrior-Prophet alone speaks the judgement of the Gods! It is you who’ve been found wanting! You who shall be punished!”</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">“False! False!—”</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">It seemed a thousand half-starved faces cried a thousand hungry things. Accusations. Curses. Laments. The air was flushed by humid cries. Hundreds had gathered within the ruined shell of the Citadel of the Dog to hear the Warrior-Prophet answer the charges of the Great and Lesser Names. Hot in the sun, the black ruins towered about them: walls unconsummated by vaults, foundations obscured by heaped wreckage, the side of a fallen tower bare and rounded against the debris, like the flanks of a whale breaching the surface of a choppy sea. The Men of the Tusk had congregated across every pitched slope and beneath every monolithic remnant. Fist-waving faces packed every pocket of clear ground.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Instinctively pulling her baby tight to her breast, Serwë glanced around in terror. <span class="italic">Esmi was right … We shouldn’t have come!</span> She looked up to Kellhus, and wasn’t surprised by the divine calm with which he observed the masses. Even here, he seemed the godlike nail which fastened what happened to what <span class="italic">should</span> happen.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">He’ll make them see!</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">But the roar was redoubled, and reverberated through her body. Several men had drawn their knives, as though the sound of fury were grounds enough for murderous riot.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">So much hatred.</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Even the Great Names, gathered in the clear centre of the fortress’s courtyard, looked apprehensive. They gazed blank-faced at the thundering mobs, almost as though they were counting. Already several fights had broken out; she could see the flash of steel and flailing monkey limbs amidst the packed mobs—believers beset by unbelievers.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">A starved fanatic with a knife managed to slip past the Hundred Pillars, rushed the Warrior-Prophet …</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">… who pinched the knife from his hand as though he were a child, clasped his throat with one hand and lifted him from the ground, like a gasping dog.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">The pocked grounds gradually quieted as more and more turned their horrified eyes to the Warrior-Prophet and his thrashing burden—until shortly only the would-be assassin could be heard, gagging. Serwë’s skin pimpled in dread. <span class="italic">Why do they do this? Why do they dare his wrath?</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Kellhus tossed the man to the ground, where he lay inert, a heap of slack limbs.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“What is it that you fear?” the Warrior-Prophet asked. His tone was both plaintive and imperious—not the overbearing manner of a King certain of his sanction, but the despotic voice of Truth.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Gotian shouldered his way passed the interceding onlookers. “The wrath of the God,” he cried, “who punishes us for harbouring an abomination!”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“No.” His flashing eyes found them from among the masses: Saubon, Proyas, Conphas, and the others. “You fear that as my power waxes, yours will wane. You do what you do not in the name of the God, but in the name of avarice. You wouldn’t tolerate even the God to possess your Holy War. And yet, in each of your hearts there is an itch, an anguished question that I alone can see: <span class="italic">What if he truly is the Prophet? What doom awaits us then?</span>”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">“SILENCE!”</span> Conphas roared, spittle flying from his contorted lips.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“And you, Conphas? What is it that you hide?”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“His words are spears!” Conphas cried to the others. “His very voice is an outrage!”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“But I ask only <span class="italic">your</span> question: <span class="italic">What if you are wrong?</span>”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Even Conphas was dumbstruck by the force of these words. It was as though the Warrior-Prophet had made this demand in the God’s own voice.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“You turn to fury in the absence of certainty,” he continued sadly. “I only ask you this: What moves your soul? What moves you to condemn me? Is it indeed the God? The God strides with certainty, with <span class="italic">glory,</span> through the hearts of men! Does the God so stride through you? <span class="italic">Does the God so stride through you?</span>”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Silence. The poignant hush of dread, as though they were a congregation of debauched children suddenly confronted by the rebuke of their godlike father. Serwë felt tears flood her cheeks.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">They see! They at last see!</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">But then a Shrial Knight, the one named Sarcellus, whose face alone remained pious and devoid of hesitation, answered the Warrior-Prophet in a loud, clear voice.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“‘All things both sacred and vile,’” the Knight-Commander said, quoting the Tusk, “‘speak to the hearts of Men, and they are bewildered, and holding out their hands to darkness, <span class="italic">they name it light</span>.’”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">The Warrior-Prophet stared at him sharply, and quoted in turn: “‘Hearken Truth, for it strides fiercely among you, and will not be denied.’”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Possessed of beatific calm, Sarcellus answered: “‘Fear him, for he is the deceiver, the Lie made Flesh, come among you to foul the waters of your heart.’”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">And the Warrior-Prophet smiled sadly. “Lie made flesh, Sarcellus?” Serwë watched his eyes search the crowds, then settle on the nearby Scylvendi. “Lie made flesh,” he repeated, staring into the fiend’s embattled face. “The hunt need not end … Remember this when you recall the secret of battle. You still command the ears of the Great.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“False Prophet,” Sarcellus continued. “Prince of <span class="italic">nothing</span>.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">As if these words had been a sign, the Shrial Knights rushed the Hundred Pillars, and there was the clash of fierce arms. Someone shrieked, and one of the Knights fell to his knees, grasping in his left hand the gushing stump where his right hand should have been. Another shriek, and then yet another, and then the starving mobs, as though sobered from a drunken stupor by the sight of blood, surged forward.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Serwë screamed, clawed at the Warrior-Prophet’s white sleeve, grasped her baby with fierce desperation. <span class="italic">This isn’t happening</span> …</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">But it was hopeless. After several moments of howling butchery, the Shrial Knights were upon them. With nightmarish horror she watched the Warrior-Prophet catch a blade in his palms, break it, and then touch the neck of his assailant. The man crumpled. Another he caught by the arm, which suddenly went limp as sackcloth, and then drove his fist through his face, as though the man’s head were a melon.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Somewhere impossibly far away, she heard Gotian roar at his men, thunder at them to stop.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">She saw a manic-faced Knight rush her, sword raised to the sun, but then he was on the ground, fumbling with a fountain of blood that had bloomed from his side, and then a rough arm was about her, tiger-striped by scars and impossibly strong.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">The Scylvendi? The Scylvendi had saved her?</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">At last bridled by their Grandmaster, the Shrial Knights relented, and stood back. They were lean and wolfish beneath their hauberks. The Tusks they bore on their stained and tattered surcoats looked threadbare and wicked.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">It seemed the whole world had erupted in a chorus of howling throats.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Gotian stepped from the sweaty thunder beyond his men, and after glancing a dark moment at Cnaiür, he turned to the Warrior-Prophet. His once aristocratic face looked haggard and bitter, the look of a man who had been harrowed by a hateful world.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“Yield, Anasûrimbor Kellhus,” he said hoarsely. “You will be scourged according to Scripture.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Serwë thrashed against the plainsman until he released her. He stared at her with savage horror, and she felt only hate—bone-snapping hate. She stumbled to Kellhus’s side, and buried her face and her child against his robes.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8"><span class="italic">“Yield!”</span> she sobbed. “My lord and master you must yield! Do not die in this place! You must not die!”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">She could feel her Prophet’s tender eyes upon her, his divine embrace encompass her. She looked up into his face and saw love in his shining, god-remote eyes. The love of the God for her! For <span class="italic">Serwë,</span> first wife and lover of the Warrior-Prophet. For the girl who was nothing …</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">Glittering tears branched across her cheeks. “I love you!” she cried. “I love you and you cannot die!”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">She looked down at the squalling babe between them. “Our son!” she sobbed. <span class="italic">“Our son needs the God!”</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">She felt rough hands pull her back, and an ache such as she’d never suffered as they pulled her from his embrace. <span class="italic">My heart! They tear me from my heart!</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“He’s the God!” she shrieked. “Can’t you see? He’s <span class="italic">the God!</span>”</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">She struggled against the man who held her, but he was too strong. <span class="italic">“The God!”</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">The man who held her spoke: “According to Scripture?” It was Sarcellus.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“According to Scripture,” the Grandmaster replied, but there was now pity in his voice.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“But she has a newborn child!” another cried—the Scylvendi … What did he mean? She looked to him, but he was a dark shadow against the congregation of warlike men, spliced by tears and sunlight.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“It matters not,” Gotian replied, his voice hardening with mad resolve.</span></div>
<div class="calibre18"><span class="calibre8">“My child!” Was there desperation, pain in the Scylvendi’s voice?</span></div>
